v1.0.7^v1.0.7 Many Stability Fixes.|- Fixed: New improved code for checking for server updates.|- Fixed: Improved code for detecting existing servers to prevent duplicate servers from starting and to allow multiple servers to be hosted on the same machine.|- Fixed: Query & telnet Watchdog was detecting server crashes but often failing to restart the server.  It is now fixed.|- Fixed: Updated the server shutdowen command to "saveandexit 0" for cleaner server shutdown.|- Changed: SteamCMD Updater: Moved force install before login|- Added: SteamCMD Updater: If any branch requires a password, including experimental, and no password given, the update check is skipped to prevent a restart loop.|- Changed: Minor improvements to the log file.|- Added: Sometimes EAH uses the Dedicated_EAH.yaml instead of teh default file.  ESUU detects this and creates a log entry and prompts user to change if connection errors occur.|- Changed: Default value for closing EAH is Always.  ESUU will now, by default, close EAH whenever servers are shut down because EAH no longer automatically reconnects when server comes online.|- Changed: Default value for watchdog Query port monitoring changed to yesd: Discord: Watchdog can announce when a server crash is first detected and when it peforms the restart.
